        times are expected in seconds.

        The annotation class contains two immutable fields: mask and events.

            fs (int): Sampling frequency in Hertz of the annotations.
            numSamples (int, optional): Is required when initalizing by providing a
                list of (start, stop) tuples. It indicates the number of annotation
                samples in the annotation binary mask. It should be left to None if
                a binary mask is provided. Defaults to None.
